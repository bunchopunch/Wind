A Wind to Shake the Stars
====

This is my Ludum Dare 31 project. Well the Dare technically lasts all weekend, aside from generating the code scaffold, all my work was done on Sunday. If you think starting at noon on Sunday and finishing by the 8:00pm deadline is difficult, it is. This explains why when the challange was up, my project could only be called a game in the most periapical sense. Instead, I tagged my failure and continued developing it until midnight, by which point it was actually a functional game.

A [GitHub page](http://bunchopunch.github.io/Wind/) should be available soon demoing the finished game.
