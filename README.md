Stellar Wind
====

[Stellar Wind](http://bunchopunch.github.io/Wind/) is my Ludum Dare 31 project, an arcade style game built in Phaser JS. The theme for this particular Dare was, "Entire Game on One Screen." 

# Retrospective
Well the Dare technically lasts for a weekend, due to other obligations my work was almost entirely done on Sunday. If you think starting at noon and finishing by the 8:00pm deadline is difficult, then you're right. That's why when the challenge was up, Stellar Wind could only be called a game in the most periapical sense. 

All that said, the lessons learned during my first attempt at the dare (LD30: Brainspeaker) helped keep Stellar Wind manageable and realistic in scope. This project did, however, reinforce in my mind that all weekend really is required to finish the challenge and that practice is necessary with Phaser, as it can be a bit quirkier than it first appeared.

On that last note, I've put a few more hours in and not only turned this project into a complete game, but also got some valuable experience with Phaser.

Stellar Wind is playable on [this projects GitHub page](http://bunchopunch.github.io/Wind/).
